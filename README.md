# OVERVIEW OF PROJECT
This project integrates the OpenWeatherMap API with Python to fetch real-time weather data for any city and visualize it interactively. It helps users understand temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions using charts and dashboards.

The main goal is to showcase API integration, data handling, and dynamic visualization — useful for students, analysts, and developers.
# Technologies used 
Technology	-------- Purpose

Python     -------- 	Core programming language

requests -------   	To fetch data from OpenWeatherMap API matplotlib, seaborn	For visual data plotting


plotly, dash (optional)	------ For interactive web-based dashboards

pandas	--------    For data wrangling and organization

datetime	--------  For date-time conversion of forecasts

# 🌟 Features used 

🌍 Fetch weather data (temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed)

📊 Visualize data using bar charts, pie charts, and dashboards

⏱️ Real-time and forecasted data handling

💡 Error handling and clean layout

📦 Easily extendable to other APIs or locations

# 🚀 How to Run the Project
🐍 1. Requirements
Install required libraries:

pip install requests pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly dash

📁 2. Save your Python file
Save the complete script (e.g., weather_dashboard.py).

▶️ 3. Run (Basic Script Version):

python weather_dashboard.py

🌐 4. Run (If using Dash for web app):

python weather_dashboard_dash.py
